                    Hi, I am Raymond, a data analyst of a furniture company until Feb 2020. After the 10 years career, I know that "passion of learning" and "logical thinking" are two of my greatest strengths. No matter the industry I am working in, I always try to find out the position where I/my team/our company is standing at, and the background knowledge I should know. Therefore, I studied the retail sales process and its logistics in my current job, also BI software and full stack engineering techniques. From the inventory analysis, I helped my company get rid of the crisis of out of stock. Our average in-stock rate was raised from around 60% in 2016 to over 80% at current time. I hope to have an opportunity to let you know how we did it.
